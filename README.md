# next-starter

A starter project for mixing Next JS and Apollo, with MUI.

I recently started a client prototype, and really liked the stack. Once everything was wired up, it was the fastest development experience I'd had yet. This repo is an attempt at documenting and refollowing the steps that put that project together.

Here are the major steps that I want to recreate. 

* [x] [Next JS](./docs/1_next.md)
* [x] [ESLint, Jest, Directory Aliasing](./docs/2_eslint.md)
* [ ] [Apollo Client](./docs/3_apollo.md)
* [ ] Serverless
* [ ] Storybook
* [ ] Plop
* [ ] Material UI

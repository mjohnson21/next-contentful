# Generating with Plop

Speaking of things that deserve their own blog post, I'll link to the post that goes thorugh this process later. In fact, I want it to be an importable package.

For now, I'm stubbing our the basic cirections for getting it running.

```
yarn add -D plop

// package.json
"generate": "plop --plopfile ./generators/plopfile.js",
```
